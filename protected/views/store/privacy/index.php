          Any communication or material you transmit to us via e-mail or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions or the like, but not including your personal information and any requests, comments or concerns regarding your personal information, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary.</p>

      <h4 class="terms-subheader">
          Location Information
      </h4>

      <p>
          When you use the Services, we may collect precise location data about the progress of your order from the DoorDash app used by the Dasher. If you permit the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“Platform”) or browser, we may also collect the precise location of your device when the DoorDash app is running in the foreground or background of your device while we are processing your order. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. We use your location information to provide more accurate deliveries of your orders. You can choose whether to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on your device or Platform or when prompted by the DoorDash mobile app. If you choose to disable the location feature, the Dasher will not receive precise location information from your device, which may compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in a large area, such as a park.</p>

      <h4 class="terms-subheader">
          Sharing with Third Parties
      </h4>

      <p>
          To help us run our business, we may share your information, including your contact information, ratings, other information you provide directly, and information collected automatically, with entities that provide services to us, including third parties that provide payment processing, advertising services, web analytics, data processing, IT services, customer support and other services. To help provide you with a high quality delivery we also may share your information, including your personal information, with the independent contractor Dashers, who complete your requested deliveries. Similarly, we may share your name, phone number, order information, customer feedback and other information related to your orders with DoorDash Food Service Providers. We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous information to these third party service providers.</p>

      <h5>
          When Required By Law
      </h5>

      <p>
          We recognize that information related to your orders could contain private information. However, we may be required to disclose your information to third parties including law enforcement agencies when required to protect and defend our legal rights, protect the safety and security of users of our Services, prevent fraud, comply with the law, respond to legal process, or a request for cooperation by a government entity. We have developed a process that strikes a balance between protecting customer privacy and responding to valid law enforcement requests that can be found at <a href="https://www.doordash.com/lert/">https://www.doordash.com/lert/</a>.</p>

      <h5>
          Corporate Transactions
      </h5>

      <p>
          In the event of sale, transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.</p>

      <h4 class="terms-subheader">
          Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information
      </h4>

      <p>
          Keeping your personal information current helps ensure that we provide you with the most relevant offers. You can access and update your personal information via your Account profile. While we are ready to assist you in managing your subscriptions, deactivating your account, and removing your active profile and data, we cannot always delete records of past interactions and transactions. For example, we are required to retain records relating to previous purchases through our Services for financial reporting and compliance reasons. In addition, because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete certain information, we may temporarily retain backup copies of such information before it is permanently deleted.</p>

      <h5>
          Data Retention
      </h5>

      <p>
          We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. We will also retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

      <p>
          DoorDash may retain aggregate or anonymized data indefinitely.</p>

      <h4 class="terms-subheader">
          Third Party Sites
      </h4>

      <p>
          Some of the functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with DoorDash. These entities may collect or receive certain information about your use of our Services and your activities over time and across different websites, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, we use services like Google Analytics to help us see traffic patterns on DoorDash.com. DoorDash is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities. In addition, our Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by DoorDash. Such websites are not under our control and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices. If you provide any personal information through any such third party website we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of that third party.</p>

Our Services also may enable you to access social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram (collectively, “Social Network”) directly or indirectly through our Services.</p> 

      <p>
          When you link a Social Network account to DoorDash or log into our Services using your Social Network account, we may collect relevant information necessary to enable our Services to access that Social Network and your data contained within that Social Network. We also may share your information with the operator of that Social Network to facilitate or enhance delivery of that Social Network or other services to you. A Social Network may provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to them, and we will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Additionally, a Social Network may collect personal information and information about your use of our Site or Services automatically. The manner in which a Social Network collects, uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed by the policies of such third parties and DoorDash shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Network that may be enabled within our Services.</p>

      <p>
          You may also have the option of posting your activities on our Services and other content to a Social Network when you access content through our Services. For example, you may post to Facebook that you placed an order with DoorDash. Keep in mind that your activity on a Social Network is governed by that Social Network and not by DoorDash, and may be visible or accessible to the public.</p>

      <h4 class="terms-subheader">
          Your Choices
      </h4>

      <p>
          If you are a registered DoorDash user you may access, modify, or delete your personal information by logging into our Site using your username and password and visiting the “Account” page. You may disable our ability to use cookies by using the cookie controls in your web browser (see “Use of Cookies” section above).</p>

      <p>
          If we send you marketing emails about services that may interest you, each email will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing or other communications.</p>

      <p>
          You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@doordash.com">privacy@doordash.com</a> to access, modify or request deletion of your personal information.</p>

          Your California Privacy Rights</h5>
      
      <p>
          Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

      </h4>
 
      <p>
          DoorDash allows users to invite friends to sign up for our Services by submitting a friend’s name and email address to DoorDash. Sometimes we offer a promotional value for every friend that signs up and places an order through your referral link. By choosing to invite a friend you represent that you have received the friend’s consent to provide his or her name and email address to us. DoorDash will use that information to send an email inviting him or her to visit the site and will store that information to track the success of the referral program.</p>

Any information we obtain about you will be stored in accordance with U.S. privacy laws, regulations, and standards, which may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence.
